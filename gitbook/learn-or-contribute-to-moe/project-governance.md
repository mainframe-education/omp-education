# Project Governance

## Overview

This project aims to be governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. All participation in this project is open and not bound to corporate affiliation. Participants are bound to the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

## Project Roles

### Editor

The Editor role is the starting role for anyone participating in the project and wishing to contribute education assets.

#### Process for becoming a Editor

* Ensure your contribution is inline with the project's guidelines
* Submit your contribution as a Change Request
* Have your submission approved by a Reviewer

### Reviewer

The Reviewer role enables the contributor to approve Change Requests, but also comes with the responsibility of being a responsible leader in the community.

The current list of active Reviewer can be seen at the [Reviewer List](../reviewer-list.md).

#### Process for becoming a Reviewer

* Show your experience with the project through contributions and engagement on the community channels.
* Voted to become a Reviewer by the majority of the currently active Reviewer.

#### Reviewer responsibilities

* Monitor Slack
* Triage Discussions
* Make sure that ongoing Change Requests are moving forward at the right pace or closing them

#### Emeritus status

If a Reviewer is no longer interested or cannot perform the duties listed above, they should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases, this can also occur by a vote of the Reviewers per the voting process below.

### Leads

The MOE Project Lead is designated to the Technical Steering Committee. They are the primary point of contact for the project and representative to the Open Mainframe Project's Technical Advisory Council. The Lead(s) will be responsible for the overall project health and direction, coordination of activities, and working with other projects and committees as needed for the continued growth of the project.

## Release Process

Project releases will occur as soon as a Reviewer approves a Change Request. Any changes will be live thereafter.

## Conflict Resolution and Voting

In general, we prefer that Issues, Discussions and Reviewer membership are amicably worked out between the persons involved.&#x20;

If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the Reviewers can be called in to decide an issue. If the Reviewers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each committer receives one vote.

## Communication

This project, just like all of open source, is a global community. In addition to the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md), this project will:

* Keep all communication on open channels
* Be respectful of time and language differences between the community members
* Ensure tools are able to be used by community members regardless of their region

If you have concerns about communication challenges for this project, [please contact a Reviewer](../reviewer-list.md).
