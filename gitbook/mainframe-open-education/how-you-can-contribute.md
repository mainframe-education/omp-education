# How You Can Contribute

We are a community-centric project and welcome the participation and contribution of all members of the mainframe community. Whether you would like to contribute content, or want to discuss existing content and how to improve it, we welcome and encourage the interaction.&#x20;

What type of content can you contribute? Content comes in all forms, the only limitation is that it should be publicly available, attributed to the author, and not violate any copyrights. We welcome links to articles, infographics, courses, videos, blog posts, podcasts and more. All submissions will be reviewed by the MOE team and upon acceptance, merged into the workspace.&#x20;

The first step as a contributor is to request editor access to this GitBook workspace. You do that through the invitation link below.&#x20;

**Step 1)** Sign in:

**Step 2)** Once your access is approved there are two ways of contributing: [**Change Request**](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/editing-pages/change-requests) and [**Discussions**](https://docs.gitbook.com/collaboration/comments). Please review the help documents to understand how these processes work.&#x20;

**Step 3)** When creating a change request first click on the "Edit" button on the top right side of the site page. Next provide a description for your request. The field is located on the top left of the site page after you click "Edit." When submitting content through the change request, provide a high-level description of the content and the name of the content creator.&#x20;

**Note:** Changes requests should be made by page. If you have suggestions to more than a page, it is required to create a Change Request per Page. Otherwise, your Change Request might be rejected.
