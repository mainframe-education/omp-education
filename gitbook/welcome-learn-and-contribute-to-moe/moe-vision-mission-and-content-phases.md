# MOE Vision, Mission and Content Phases

[Mainframe Open Education (MOE)](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/mainframeopeneducation) is sponsored by the [Open Mainframe Project ](https://openmainframeproject.org/)[(OMP)](https://openmainframeproject.org/). The community partnership focuses on ‘open sourcing’ mainframe learning roadmaps and community knowledge transfer. To make it easier for hiring managers to have access to a plan and co-develop valuable assets – much of it in the minds and archives of our respective organizations.&#x20;

### Vision

The vision of MOE is to build a place for mainframe experts to share and consume the tribal knowledge they gained with years of experience. MOE board of experts will promote submissions within quality standards for the end user - all are cataloged in a consumable roadmap orientation. There are thousands of experts in the market to pass knowledge to the next generation. Join the project to learn about this community partnership and how to participate and contribute.

### Content Phases

The project was designed based on five initial phases. Our goal is to ensure we have the most relevant information organized in a logical and accessible way for the community. This structure is a starting point where the [personas](../learn-or-contribute-to-moe/what-personas-can-contribute.md) can contribute and collaborate to develop and continuously improve the content library.&#x20;
