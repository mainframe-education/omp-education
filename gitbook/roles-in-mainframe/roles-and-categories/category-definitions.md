The bad news is the learning journey involving a variety of combined job roles and responsibilities will take longer to master.  Also, the medium and small IT organizations are more likely to recruit those with experience from other IT organizations.

What all the enterprise IT production organizations have in common is collection, storage, and processing of data securely.  What makes various industry enterprise IT production different is the volume of data, variety of data,  regulations applied to the data, and speed at which the data must be processed.

The job roles and responsibilities include significant combination of duties discussed in the Large Enterprise IT Production.

·        Operations responsibilities for all Operations which potentially could include Systems Programming and Systems Administrator job responsibilities.

## Independent Software Vendors and IBM

Independent Software Vendors, ISVs, provide software to production IT organizations necessary to run and support the Production IT business application services.

Enterprise IT may have software engineers titles, job roles and responsibilities.  It is more likely Independent Software Vendor and Consulting/Integration organizations will have software engineer titles as a result of specific software product offerings and/or service/support offerings provided to enterprise IT organizations.

IBM provides the IBM Z mainframe hardware with support and services.  IBM provides the IBM Z mainframe operating systems such as z/OS with support and services.

Production IT organizations will typically purchase software from ISVs.  It is in the best interest of production IT organizations to purchase software which comes with on-going support, services, maintenance, and feature/function enhancements.  In the long run it is far more cost effective for the company than writing and maintaining software in the majority of situations.  Many production IT job responsibilities include installation, configuration, implementation, and production support for these ISV software products.

Production IT support personal have an immediate escalation support organization to contact when problems are encountered involving these ISV software products.  The ISV support includes highly experienced technical personal that enables you to resolve problems with their products quickly while advancing your technical skills.

In addition to IBM providing the IBM Z mainframe, IBM provides hardware support and services, operating system support and services, and operating system software product support and services.  Many production IT job responsibilities include installation, configuration, implementation, and production support for IBM Z hardware, operating systems, and software products.

Production IT support personnel have an immediate escalation support organization to contact when problems are encountered involving the IBM Z mainframe, operating systems, and software products.

The IBM Z mainframe is playing a significantly bigger role in the large scale business solutions today and will be playing a bigger role in the future as a result of the ‘holy grail’ of IT business application processing – prescriptive analytics at time of transaction.  Recent technology advancements in IBM Z mainframe hardware and software opened the door for development and implementation of prescriptive analytics and time of transaction.  A set of ‘Data Science’ job roles exist and will grow as a result.

An internet search ‘prescriptive analytics’ provides insight into this job category.  While IBM and ISVs provide software to help implement prescriptive analytics, the purchase of software follows a developed business solution plan by the production IT organization typically with the assistance of System Integration Consultants.
