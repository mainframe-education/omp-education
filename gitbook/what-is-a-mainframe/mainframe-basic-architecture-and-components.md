# Mainframe Basic Architecture & Components

### a) Mainframe Key Components <a href="#a-mainframe-key-components" id="a-mainframe-key-components"></a>

Previously, the term mainframe was synonymous with the hardware (S/360, S/370, S/390 chips) and software (MVS, VM, VSE). However, nowadays, the term mainframe has a more complex meaning. The term mainframe must be divided into two meanings: (1) the hardware (Z-Series chip) and (2) the operating systems supported by the Z-Series chip (z/VM, z/OS, z/VSE, Linux).

* **Mainframe Hardware:** Z-Series CPU chips: Supports z/VM, z/OS, z/VSE, Linux operating systems, and open source software. Also supports Hybrid Cloud technology. Mainframe hardware includes outboard I/O and encryption CPUs, Hyper Channels, redundant power supplies, and resilience.
* **Mainframe Software:** Z-Series software: this software is what is traditionally referred to as VM, z/VM, MVS, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, z/OS, VSE or z/VSE. These operating systems have evolved and been used over the last 50 years. Mainframe software has evolved from a purely batch oriented system using only JCL to incorporating real time interfaces and Unix System Service.  Mainframe software has progressed to being compatible with distributed systems, with [Zowe](https://www.zowe.org) being the most notable innovation. &#x20;

Assembling the IBM Z mainframe in 120 seconds - IBM unveiled IBM Z, the next generation of the world’s most powerful transaction system, capable of running more than 12 billion encrypted transactions per day. The new system also introduces a breakthrough encryption engine that, for the first time, makes it possible to pervasively encrypt data associated with any application, cloud service or database all the time.

### b) Virtual Tour on a Mainframe <a href="#b-virtual-tour-on-a-mainframe" id="b-virtual-tour-on-a-mainframe"></a>

We would like to invite you to do an online tour inside the mainframe hardware.  In this virtual tour you can explore the mainframe, open doors, remove switches and understand what the physical hardware of a mainframe looks like today from the comfort of your own home.&#x20;

From the link above, choose the **“Run Online/Web”** option, and choose **“System/Server”**. Pick IBM Z for the latest mainframe. Then you just need to click on the latest machine type, which is at the top of the list, once you join in the machine, find “Explore Product Animation” where you can navigate through all the machine details.&#x20;
