# Digital Certificate Badges

In 2016 a new way of learning and earning credentials in the IT world was launched. Digital Certificate Badges allow you to easily share your achievements on social media. The Badges are based on a specific topic and expertise area. As you learn, you earn Digital Certificates Badges to add to your curriculum, on your social media and share with others. It is a great new way of learning that helps you to increase your skills while you also engage with the community.

Mainframe ecosystem embraced this approach, and we can find most of the mainframe content in a Badge layout. In this section you will find some initial free of charge recommendations on how to earn Badges and start to leverage your skills in mainframe.
