# Mainframe Open Education

[Mainframe Open Education (MOE)](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/mainframeopeneducation) is sponsored by the Open Mainframe Project. It is a community partnership that focuses on ‘open sourcing’ mainframe learning roadmaps and community knowledge transfer. The MOE mission is to offer all mainframe users a platform to cultivate skill onboarding that is most critical to future hires and to allow for knowledge sharing and community contribution.&#x20;

### **Why?**&#x20;

To make it easier for hiring managers to have access to a plan and co-develop valuable assets – much of it in the minds and archives of our respective organizations. The vision of this project is a place for mainframe experts to share and consume the tribal knowledge they gained with years of experience. MOE board of experts will promote submissions within standards of quality for the end user, all catalogued in a consumable, roadmap orientation. There are thousands of experts in market to pass knowledge to the next generation. Join the project to learn about this community partnership and how to participate and contribute.
