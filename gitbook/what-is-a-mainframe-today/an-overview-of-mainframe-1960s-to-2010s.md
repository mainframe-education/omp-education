# An Overview of Mainframe: 1960s to 2010s

The evolution of human computation, from ancient tally sticks to the modern marvels of technology, traces a fascinating journey. The series of videos below delves into the rich tapestry of computing history, from Stonehenge and abacuses to the revolutionary era of mainframes. Alan Turing's groundbreaking algorithms and the commercial dawn of computers in the mid-20th century set the stage for a transformative period in business computing.

Amid the cultural upheavals of the 1960s, IBM's 360 emerged as the harbinger of modern mainframes, reshaping business computing and empowering endeavors like NASA's space missions.
