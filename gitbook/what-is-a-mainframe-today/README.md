~~Mainframes are computers. They are known by their reliability, security, huge capacity, high performance, large amounts of memory and processors.  A mainframe computer can handle many tasks concurrently and is critical to commercial databases, transaction servers, and applications that require high resilience, security, and agility.~~&#x20;

~~For that reason these computers are robust, rugged, reliable, secured, and available for nonstop **24×7** operations. Despite the complexity of this huge computer it is closer to you than you can imagine. You might have never heard about the mainframe, however it is with you since you wake up in the morning.~~ \
