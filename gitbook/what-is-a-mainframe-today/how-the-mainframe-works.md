# How the Mainframe Works



IBM mainframes are not just computers; they're technological marvels. From running operating systems like Linux® and IBM z/OS® to orchestrating massive simultaneous transactions and ensuring top-tier security, these machines are at the forefront of innovation.

Join us as we delve into the intricacies of mainframe engineering—uncovering their capacity on demand, shared memory dynamics, and the impressive execution of secure web transactions. We'll unravel the layers of redundancy that make them resilient in the face of extreme conditions.

<mark style="background-color:blue;">Watch the video "What is a Mainframe" by Dr. Philipp Brune, and answer the following questions:</mark>&#x20;

1. <mark style="background-color:blue;">What are the key differences between the mainframe paradigm and the cloud or grid paradigm regarding architecture and scalability?</mark>
2. <mark style="background-color:blue;">How does the shared memory architecture of mainframes contribute to their suitability for applications requiring high transaction security and efficient information sharing among parallel transactions?</mark>
3. <mark style="background-color:blue;">In what ways does the hardware architecture of mainframes, originating from the IBM S/360 generation, demonstrate a unique aspect through its full backward compatibility despite the evolution in appearance?</mark>

As you can see, IBM mainframes are uniquely engineered to:

* Run common operating systems like [Linux®](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/os/linux), specialized operating systems such as IBM [z/OS®](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/zos), and software that takes advantage of unique hardware capabilities.
* Support massive simultaneous [transactions](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/capabilities/transaction-processing) and throughput (I/O) with built-in capacity on demand and built-in shared memory for direct application communication.
* Deliver the highest levels of [security](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/capabilities/enterprise-security) with built-in cryptographic cards and innovative software. For instance, the latest [IBM Z®](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/hardware) mainframes can execute up to 1 trillion secure web transactions per day and manage privacy by policy.
* Offer [resiliency](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/capabilities/resiliency) through multiple layers of redundancy for every component (power supplies, cooling, backup batteries, CPUs, I/O components, cryptography modules) and testing for extreme weather conditions.\
