# How the Mainframe Works



IBM mainframes are uniquely engineered to:

* Run common operating systems like [Linux®](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/os/linux), specialized operating systems such as IBM [z/OS®](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/zos), and software that takes advantage of unique hardware capabilities.
* Support massive simultaneous [transactions](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/capabilities/transaction-processing) and throughput (I/O) with built-in capacity on demand and built-in shared memory for direct application communication.
* Deliver the highest levels of [security](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/capabilities/enterprise-security) with built-in cryptographic cards and innovative software. For instance, the latest [IBM Z®](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/hardware) mainframes can execute up to 1 trillion secure web transactions per day and manage privacy by policy.
* Offer [resiliency](https://www.ibm.com/za-en/it-infrastructure/z/capabilities/resiliency) through multiple layers of redundancy for every component (power supplies, cooling, backup batteries, CPUs, I/O components, cryptography modules) and testing for extreme weather conditions.\
