# Mainframe Basic Architecture & Components

Beyond the imposing presence of the big black box lies the intricate and sophisticated physical architecture of this technological marvel. But it's not just about the hardware; it's about unveiling the next generation of the world’s most powerful transaction system—IBM Z.

IBM Z introduces a groundbreaking encryption engine capable of executing more than 12 billion encrypted transactions per day. This engine is a game-changer, enabling pervasive encryption of data associated with any application, cloud service, or database all the time. Join us on this rapid journey behind the scenes as we explore the magic that transforms these physical components into the powerhouse of IBM Z. Let's witness the assembly of innovation!

### a) Mainframe Key Components <a href="#a-mainframe-key-components" id="a-mainframe-key-components"></a>

Previously, the term mainframe was synonymous with the hardware (S/360, S/370, S/390 chips) and software (MVS, VM, VSE). However, nowadays, the term mainframe has a more complex meaning. The term mainframe must be divided into two meanings: (1) the **hardware** (Z-Series chip) and (2) the **operating systems supported by the Z-Series chip** (z/VM, z/OS, z/VSE, Linux).

* **Mainframe Hardware:** Z-Series CPU chips: Supports z/VM, z/OS, z/VSE, Linux operating systems, and open-source software. Also supports Hybrid Cloud technology. Mainframe hardware includes outboard I/O and encryption CPUs, hyperchannels, redundant power supplies, and resilience.
* **Mainframe Software:** Z-Series software is traditionally called VM, z/VM, MVS, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, z/OS, VSE or z/VSE. These operating systems have evolved and been used over the last 50 years. Mainframe software has evolved from a purely batch-oriented system using only JCL to incorporating real-time interfaces and Unix System Service. Mainframe software has progressed to being compatible with distributed systems, with [Zowe](https://www.zowe.org) being the most notable innovation. &#x20;
