  "content"  : "Mainframe Fundamental Skills\nBy now, you should already know what a Mainframe is; as a next step, we prepared a section for those looking for guidance about Mainframe architecture and software. \nThe objective of this session is to share with you the initial information about the Foundation concepts about the Mainframe architecture, how and from where you should start.\nThere are some excellent courses available for the community at no cost that we will share here. As education is constantly evolving, we encourage you to share the existing guidance with anyone interested in learning about the Mainframe or with experts who are willing to add value and new content to this section.\n\nWe hope you enjoy it!\n\nDigital Certificate Badges\nSince 2016, a new way of learning and earning credentials in the IT world has been launched. The Digital Certificated Badges allow you to share your achievements with your social media easily. The Badges are based on a specific topic and expertise area. As you learn, you earn badges to add to your curriculum, on your social media, and share with others. It is a great new way of learning that helps you increase your skills while also engaging the community. The Mainframe ecosystem embraced this approach, and we can find most of the Mainframe content in a Badge layout. In this section, you will find some initial recommendations, free of charge, to earn Badges and start to leverage your skills in Mainframe\n\nz/OS Mainframe Practitioner\nOne good recommendation to start is the z/OS Mainframe Practitioner Badge. It was created by IBM.\nBadge Description: This badge earner has developed foundational skills in IBM Z hardware and software, especially around z/OS and System Administration. Through hands-on labs working on a live IBM Z server, the earner has gained real-world experience and is equipped to pursue a career as a mainframe application developer, system programmer, system administrator, or DBA Practitioner.\nSkills: Technical Specialist | Security | Telecommunications | Adaptability &amp;amp; Flexibility | Linux | Mainframe | Z Systems | IBM z\nTo earn the badge, follow the instructions on link\n\nWhat it takes to earn this badge\nComplete all courses in the z/OS Mainframe Practitioner Professional Certificate program on Coursera (including quizzes, hands-on assignments, and projects), and earn the following badges:\n Introduction to Enterprise Computing badge.\n Getting Started on Mainframe with z/OS Commands and Panels badge.\n Basic System Programming on IBM Z badge.\n\nNew topics to be released soon:\n1 Glossary (Acronyms mainframe related)\n\nHow to contribute to this section?\n\n  Go to link\n  Follow the steps described in the README file\n\n"

  "content"  : "What is Mainframe\nMainframes are computers. They are known for their vast capacity, high performance, large amounts of memory, and processors.  Mainframe computers can handle many tasks concurrently, and they are critical to commercial databases, transaction servers, and applications that require high resiliency, security, and agility.\nFor that reason, these computers are robust, rugged, reliable, secured, and available for nonstop 24×7 operations.\nBehind the complexity of this enormous computer, it is closer to you than you would imagine. You might never hear about the Mainframe; however, it has been with you since you wake up in the morning.\n\nWho Uses the Mainframe and why?\nYou might not know, but the Mainframe is part of your daily routine. You are not a direct user of it, but you definitely are an end-user of most financial, enterprise, retail, and data management transactions we interact with during your day. All types and sizes of businesses and organizations can leverage the Mainframe as technology to support your business. The most common are:\n\n  Big organization to manage enterprise-wide mission-critical ERP operations,\n  Banks to handle to trillion of transactions,\n  Back-end operations of many digital applications.\n\n\nTopics to explore more: Role of the Mainframe Today: Why is it so relevant today? Talk about hybrid cloud, how it influenced IT today.\n\nMainframe Basic Architecture &amp;amp; Components\n\nMainframe Key Components\nMainframe In the past, the term Mainframe was synonymous with the hardware (S360/370/390 chips) and software (MVS, VM, VSE).  However, nowadays, the term Mainframe now has a more complex meaning.\n The term Mainframe must be divided into two meanings:\nThe hardware (Z-Series chip) \nThe operating systems that are supported by the Z-Series chip (Z/VM, Z/OS, Z/VSE, Linux).\n\nMainframe Hardware\n\nZ-Series CPU chips:  Supports Z/VM, Z/OS, Z/VSE, Linux operating systems, and open-source software.  It also supports Hybrid Cloud technology.  Mainframe hardware includes outboard I/O and encryption CPUs, Hyper Channels, redundant power supplies, and resilience.\n\nMainframe Software\n\nZ-Series software: this software is traditionally referred to as VM, z/VM, MVS, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, z/OS, VSE, or z/VSE.  These operating systems have evolved and been used over the last 50 years.  Mainframe software has evolved from a purely batch-oriented system using only JCL to incorporating real-time interfaces and Unix System Service.  Mainframe software has progressed to being compatible with distributed systems, the most notable innovation being ZOWE.\n\nVirtual Tour on a Mainframe\nWe want to invite you to do an online tour inside the Mainframe Hardware.  In this Virtual tour, you can reach the mainframe machine, open doors, remove switches and understand how Mainframe Hardware looks today. Click here, then choose the “Run Online/Web” Option, after we recommend to start from the “System/Server”, IBM Z is the Mainframe. Then you just need to click on the latest machine type, which will be on the top of the list. Once you join the machine, you might find “Explore Product Animation” where you can navigate all the machine details.\n\nMainframe brief History and Timeline\nMainframe mission from the ’50s until the 21st century, and its future. Learn more about Mainframe history\n\nMainframe versus Servers\nIf you have never heard about Mainframe, a good starting point is to compare it with the most common Servers for end-users. You can find the comparison table to bridge the existing knowledge with the Mainframe concepts and capacity here\n\nHow to contribute to this section?\n\n  Go to link\n  Follow the steps described in the README file\n\n"
