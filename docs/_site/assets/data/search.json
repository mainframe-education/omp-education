  "content"  : "1 MF Fundamentals Concepts\nAs of now you should already know what is a Mainframe, as a next step we prepared a section for whom is looking for guidance about Mainframe architecture and softwares. \nThe objective of this session is to share with you the initial information about the Foundation concepts about the Mainframe architecture, how and from where you should start.\nThere are some good courses available for the community with no cost that will be shared here. As education is always evolving we also encourage you to share the existing guidance with anyone interest to learn about mainframe or with experts that are willing to add value and new content to this section. \nHope you enjoy it!\n\n2 Digital Certificate Badges\nSince 2016 it was launched a new way of learn and earn credentials in the IT world. The Digital Certificated Badges allow you to easily share your achievements with your social media. The Badges are based in a specific topic and expertise area. As you learn, you earn Digital Certificates badge to add on your curriculum, on your social media and share with others. It is a great new way of learn that help you to encrease your skills while you also engage the community. Mainframe ecossistem embraced this approach and we can find most of the Mainframe content in a Badge layout. In this section you will find some initial recommendation, free of charge, to earn Badges and start to leverage your skills in Mainframe\n\n3 z/OS Mainframe Practitioner \nOne good recommendation to start is the z/OS Mainframe Practitioner Badge. It was built by IBM.\nBadge Description: This badge earner has developed foundational skills in IBM Z hardware and software, especially around z/OS and System Administration.

  "content"  : "What is Mainframe\nMainframes are computers. They are known by your huge capacity, high performance, large amounts of memory and processors.  Mainframe computer can handle many tasks concurrently and they are critical to commercial databases, transaction servers, and applications that require high resiliency, security, and agility.\nFor that reason these computers are robust, rugged, reliable, secured, and available for nonstop 24×7 operations.\nBehind the complexity of this huge computer it is closer to you than what you would imagine. You might never heard about the mainframe, however it is with you since you wake up in the morning. \n\nWho Uses the Mainframe and why? \nYou might not know mainframe, however it is part of your daily routine. You are not a direct user of Mainframe, but you definetly are a end user of most of the financial, enterprise, retail and data management transactions we interact during your day. All types and sizes of business and organization can leverage the Mainframe as technology to support your business. The most common are:\n\n  Big organization to manage enterprise-wide mission-critical ERP operations, \n  Banks to handle to trillion of transactions, \n  Back end operations of many digital applications. \n \nTopics to explore more: Role of the Mainframe Today: Why is it so relevant today? Talk about hybrid cloud, how it influenced IT today \n\n\nMainframe Basic Architecture &amp;amp; Components\n\nMainframe Key Components\nMainframe In the past, the term Mainframe was synonymous with the hardware (S360/370/390 chips) and software (MVS, VM, VSE).  However, nowadays, term mainframe now has a more complex meaning.\n The term Mainframe must be divided into two meanings.  (1) the hardware (Z-Series chip) and (2) the operating systems supported by the Z-Series chip (Z/VM, Z/OS, Z/VSE, Linux).\n\nMainframe Hardware\n \n Z-Series CPU chips:  Supports Z/VM, Z/OS, Z/VSE, Linux operating systems, and open source software.  Also supports Hybrid Cloud technology.  Mainframe hardware includes outboard I/O and encryption CPUs, Hyper Channels, redundant power supplies, and resilience.\n\nMainframe Software\n\nZ-Series software: this software is what is traditionally referred to as VM, z/VM, MVS, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, z/OS, VSE or z/VSE.  These operating systems have evolved and used over the last 50 years.  Mainframe software has evolved from a purely batch oriented system using only JCL to incorporating real time interfaces and Unix System Service.  Mainframe software has progressed to being compatible to distributed systems, the most notable innovating being ZOWE.\n \nVirtual Tour on a Mainframe\nWe would invite you to do an online tour inside the Mainframe Hardware.  In this Virtual tour you can reach the mainframe machine, open doors, remove switches and understand how Mainframe Hardware looks like today. Click here, then choose the “Run Online/Web” Option, after we recommend to start from the “System/Server”, IBM Z is the Mainframe. Then you just need to click on the latest machine type, which will be on the top of the list, once you join in the machine you might find “Explore Product Animation” where you can navigate thru all the machine details. \n\nMainframe brief History and Timeline\nMainframe mission from the 50’s until 21st century and it’s future. Learn more about Mainframe history\n\nMainframe versus Servers \nIf you never hear about mainframe, a good starting point is to compare with the most common Servers for us as end users. The Comparison table to bridge the the existing knowledge with the Mainframe concepts and capacity can be found here\n\nHow Mainframe is evolving thru the decades \nAs you saw in the brief history and timeline topic, Mainframe is around since 1950s, that’s why, if you had already heard about Mainframe it may sounds like something old. Others might never heard about Mainframe.\nMainframe is a growth area, since it’s beginning with the contribution to the NASA studies, until today supporting most of our daily transactions\n\nHow to contribute with this section?\n\n  Go to link\n  Select “Posts” folder\n  Find the section title you would like to update / or create a new file, for a new section\n  Add your content on the text fiel.
