# What is Mainframe
Mainframes are computers. They are known for their vast capacity, high performance, large amounts of memory, and processors.  Mainframe computers can handle many tasks concurrently, and they are critical to commercial databases, transaction servers, and applications that require high resiliency, security, and agility.
For that reason, these computers are robust, rugged, reliable, secured, and available for nonstop **24Ã—7** operations.
Behind the complexity of this enormous computer, it is closer to you than you would imagine. You might never hear about the Mainframe; however, it has been with you since you wake up in the morning. 

# Who Uses the Mainframe and why? 
You might not know, but the Mainframe is part of your daily routine. You are not a direct user of it, but you definitely are an end-user of most financial, enterprise, retail, and data management transactions we interact with during your day. All types and sizes of businesses and organizations can leverage the Mainframe as technology to support your business. The most common are:
1. Big organization to manage enterprise-wide mission-critical ERP operations, 
2. Banks to handle to trillion of transactions, 
3. Back-end operations of many digital applications.

# Mainframe Basic Architecture & Components

## Mainframe Key Components
Mainframe In the past, the term Mainframe was synonymous with the hardware (S360/370/390 chips) and software (MVS, VM, VSE).  However, nowadays, the term Mainframe now has a more complex meaning.
 The term Mainframe must be divided into two meanings:
The hardware (Z-Series chip) 
The operating systems that are supported by the Z-Series chip (Z/VM, Z/OS, Z/VSE, Linux).
 
### Mainframe Hardware
 
 Z-Series CPU chips:  Supports Z/VM, Z/OS, Z/VSE, Linux operating systems, and open-source software.  It also supports Hybrid Cloud technology.  Mainframe hardware includes outboard I/O and encryption CPUs, Hyper Channels, redundant power supplies, and resilience. 
 
### Mainframe Software

Z-Series software: this software is traditionally referred to as VM, z/VM, MVS, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, z/OS, VSE, or z/VSE.  These operating systems have evolved and been used over the last 50 years.  Mainframe software has evolved from a purely batch-oriented system using only JCL to incorporating real-time interfaces and Unix System Service.  Mainframe software has progressed to being compatible with distributed systems, the most notable innovation being ZOWE.
 
## Virtual Tour on a Mainframe
We want to invite you to do an online tour inside the Mainframe Hardware.  In this Virtual tour, you can reach the mainframe machine, open doors, remove switches and understand how Mainframe Hardware looks today. Click [here](http://m.kaon.com/c/ib), then choose the **"Run Online/Web"** Option, after we recommend to start from the **"System/Server"**, IBM Z is the Mainframe. Then you just need to click on the latest machine type, which will be on the top of the list. Once you join the machine, you might find "Explore Product Animation" where you can navigate all the machine details. 

# Mainframe brief History and Timeline

# Mainframe versus Servers 
If you have never heard about Mainframe, a good starting point is to compare it with the most common Servers for end-users. You can find the comparison table to bridge the existing knowledge with the Mainframe concepts and capacity [here](https://www.educba.com/mainframe-vs-server/)
