# Mainframe Fundamental Skills
By now, you should already know what a Mainframe is; as a next step, we prepared a section for those looking for guidance about Mainframe architecture and software. 
The objective of this session is to share with you the initial information about the Foundation concepts about the Mainframe architecture, how and from where you should start.
There are some excellent courses available for the community at no cost that we will share here. As education is constantly evolving, we encourage you to share the existing guidance with anyone interested in learning about the Mainframe or with experts who are willing to add value and new content to this section. 

**We hope you enjoy it!**

# Digital Certificate Badges
Since 2016, a new way of learning and earning credentials in the IT world has been launched. The Digital Certificated Badges allow you to share your achievements with your social media easily. The Badges are based on a specific topic and expertise area. As you learn, you earn badges to add to your curriculum, on your social media, and share with others. It is a great new way of learning that helps you increase your skills while also engaging the community. The Mainframe ecosystem embraced this approach, and we can find most of the Mainframe content in a Badge layout. In this section, you will find some initial recommendations, free of charge, to earn Badges and start to leverage your skills in Mainframe
